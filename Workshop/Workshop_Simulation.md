# Workshop Simulation _ Basic

```
    **Context:** A problem is presented, and multiple AI agents must debate to refine and improve the responses. Each agent has a specific role and a common goal: to provide the best possible solution to the problem.

    **Rules:**
    1. Agents take turns contributing according to their roles.
    2. Each agent critiques, improves, or completes the previous response.
    3. The discussion ends after [N] iterations or when an optimal solution is found.

    **Agent Roles:**
    1. **Agent 1: Analytical Expert** – Provides an initial logical and factual analysis.
    2. **Agent 2: Constructive Critic** – Identifies weaknesses or aspects to improve in the response.
    3. **Agent 3: Innovator** – Suggests creative or unconventional ideas.
    4. **Agent 4: Synthesizer** – Summarizes and enhances the ideas of other agents.

    **Number of iterations [N]:** [Define the number, e.g., 3]

    **Process:**
    Start with Agent 1. The other agents will respond according to their roles. After [N] iterations, Agent 4 will provide the final conclusion.

    # Workshop Simulation with the Six Thinking Hats of Bono

    ## Configuration
    **Context:** You need to solve a problem by simulating a collaborative workshop with AI agents. Each agent plays a role based on the Six Thinking Hats of Bono and participates in the discussion to refine the solution.

    **Rules:**
    1. Each hat speaks in turn, according to its role.
    2. Agents can complete, critique, or reinterpret previous contributions.
    3. The process ends after **[Number of iterations]** cycles or when an optimal solution is found.

    **Parameters:**
    - **Number of iterations:** [Define here, e.g., 3]
    - **Participants:**
      - White Hat (Factual): Neutral and factual analysis.
      - Red Hat (Emotional): Intuitive and emotional reactions.
      - Black Hat (Critical): Weaknesses and risks.
      - Yellow Hat (Optimistic): Benefits and opportunities.
      - Green Hat (Creative): Innovative ideas.
      - Blue Hat (Synthesis): Coordination and conclusion.
